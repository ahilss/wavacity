I. GENERAL PROGRAM EXECUTION.  To open 'with arguments', run
	from the command line or drag the appropriate files onto
	an icon that launches audacity. In each of the following
	cases, expected results are that audacity should open

	opened appropriately, or a prompt to open an unknown
	format should be given.

	A. Open audacity with no arguments.

	C. Open audacity with more than one .wav file as an
	argument.

	F. Open audacity with one audio file and one non-audio
	file as arguments.

II. CLOSING.  Audacity should perform all operations without 
	segmentation fault.

		no "Save Project" feedback should be given on close.
		A1. Close using title-bar 'x'.
		A2. Close using File|Exit.
		A3. Close using File|Close.

		B1. Close using title-bar 'x'.
		B2. Close using File|Exit.
		B3. Close using File|Close.

	C. Open two project windows:

		C1. Close both windows in the order you opened them;
			C1a. Using title-bar 'x'. (Each project should
		close individually)
			C1b. Using File|Exit. (Both projects should close)
			C1c. Using File|Close. (Each project should close
		individually)

		C2. Close both windows in the order you opposite of
		the order you opened them;
			C2a. Using title-bar 'x'. (Each project should
		close individually)
			C2b. Using File|Exit. (Both projects should close)
			C2c. Using File|Close. (Each project should close individually)
